This is the source code for my personal developer portfolio, a fully responsive and interactive website designed to showcase my skills in modern web development, 3D graphics, and machine learning.

About The Project
This portfolio is more than just a resume; it's a demonstration of what can be built with modern web technologies. It leverages the power of React, Three.js, and Framer Motion to create an engaging and memorable user experience. The goal was to build a site that is not only visually appealing but also performant and fully responsive across all devices.

Key Features:
Interactive 3D Graphics: Features stunning 3D models and animations created with React Three Fiber and Drei.

Smooth Animations: Implements complex and beautiful animations throughout the site using Framer Motion.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

Functional Contact Form: Includes a working contact form powered by EmailJS, allowing visitors to get in touch directly.

Modern UI/UX: A clean, professional, and dark-themed design built with Tailwind CSS.

Tech Stack
This project was built using the following technologies:

Frontend: React, Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

3D & Animation: Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, Framer Motion

Email Services: EmailJS

Deployment: Vercel

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

npm

npm install npm@latest -g

Installation
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Navigate to the project directory

cd your-repo-name

Install NPM packages

npm install

Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following variables. You can get these from your EmailJS account dashboard.

VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key

Run the development server

npm run dev

The site should now be running on http://localhost:5173/ (or another port if 5173 is in use).

Deployment
This site is deployed on Vercel. The vercel.json file in the root directory is configured to handle client-side routing and ensure that static assets (like the downloadable resume) are served correctly. Any push to the main branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a new deployment.
